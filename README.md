This Project performs object detection and tracking in a video using the YOLO model. Here's a short explanation:

Load YOLO Model: It loads a pre-trained YOLO model (yolo11l.pt) for detecting specific classes of objects (e.g., vehicles).

Open Video: The video file /content/Vehicles.mp4 is opened for processing.

Draw Detection Line: A red line is drawn on the frame to monitor objects crossing it.

Object Detection and Tracking: YOLO detects objects in each video frame, returning bounding boxes, class indices, and unique track IDs.

Track Center Points: The center point of each detected object is calculated for tracking purposes.

Crossing Line Check: Objects crossing the red line are identified, and their class counts are updated.

Annotate Objects: Bounding boxes, labels, and tracking IDs are drawn on detected objects in the frame.

Display Counts: A count of crossed objects is displayed on the video frame.

Show Frame: The processed frame is displayed using cv2_imshow.

Cleanup: Resources are released when the video ends or the user exits.

This script combines YOLO-based detection with simple tracking and counting logic.
